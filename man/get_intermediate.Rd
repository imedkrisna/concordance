\usage{
get_intermediate(sourcevar, origin)
}
\arguments{
\item{sourcevar}{An input character vector of industry codes to look up.}

\item{origin}{A string indicating one of the following industry/product classifications: "HS0" (1988/92), "HS1" (1996), "HS2" (2002), "HS3" (2007), "HS4" (2012), "HS5" (2017), "HS" (combined), "SITC1" (1950), "SITC2" (1974), "SITC3" (1985), "SITC4" (2006), "NAICS2002", "NAICS2007", "NAICS2012", "NAICS2017", "ISIC2" (1968), "ISIC3" (1989), "ISIC4" (2008), "BEC4" (2016).}
}
\value{
Uses keywords ("part(s)", "intermediate", and "component") to identify intermediate-goods producing industries (at the most disaggregated level in the description data), and then calculates and returns the proportion these industries occupy among each input code.
}
\description{
Calculates and returns the level (proportion) of intermediate goods production in an industry based on product descriptions.
}
\note{
Please include leading zeros in codes (e.g., use HS code 010110 instead of 10110). For BEC4 only, use original codes or add trailing zeroes if necessary (e.g., 7 or 700 instead of 007). Also note that the results may not be informative for broad categories like BEC4.
