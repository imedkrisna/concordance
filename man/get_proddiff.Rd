\usage{
get_proddiff(sourcevar, origin, setting = "CON", prop = "")
}
\arguments{
\item{sourcevar}{An input character vector of industry/product codes.}

\item{origin}{A string setting the input coding scheme. Supports the following classifications: "HS0" (1988/92), "HS1" (1996), "HS2" (2002), "HS3" (2007), "HS4" (2012), "HS5" (2017), "HS" (combined), "SITC1" (1950), "SITC2" (1974), "SITC3" (1985), "SITC4" (2006), "NAICS2002", "NAICS2007", "NAICS2012", "NAICS2017", "ISIC2" (1968), "ISIC3" (1989), "ISIC4" (2008), "BEC4" (2016).}

\item{setting}{Choose "CON" (conservative, default) or "LIB" (liberal) classification.}

\item{prop}{Can be set to "n", "r", or "w", in which case the function will return, respectively, the proportion of type "n", "r", or "w" in the resulting vector of Rauch indices. If prop is not set to any of these, then the function returns, for each input code, a dataframe that summarizes all the frequencies and proportions of type "w", "r", and "n".}
}
\value{
Concords each element of the input vector to 4-digit SITC2 codes, then uses the corresponding codes as input to extract Rauch product differentiation indices.
}
\description{
Returns Rauch's classification of product differentiation. Rauch classifies 4-digit SITC2 codes according to three possible types: differentiated products ("n"), reference priced ("r"), and homogeneous goods traded on an organized exchange ("w").
}
\note{
Please include leading zeros in codes (e.g., use HS code 010110 instead of 10110). For BEC4 only, use original codes or add trailing zeroes if necessary (e.g., 7 or 700 instead of 007). Results may be buggy otherwise.

# BEC4 input
get_proddiff(sourcevar = c("11", "21"), origin = "BEC4", setting = "CON", prop = "")
